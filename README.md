# 🚀 ML Learning Journey

This repository documents my personal growth in the field of Machine Learning.  
Each folder and project represents a new concept, algorithm, or technique that I have learned and applied.

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Machine Learning
- Apply popular algorithms through hands-on projects
- Understand data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and optimization
- Develop a portfolio that reflects my progress and skills

## 🧠 What I Am Learning

- Good preprocessing is essential for good results
- Different models behave differently depending on the dataset
- Accuracy alone is not enough — Confusion Matrix reveals real insights
- Reproducibility matters, so set a `random_state` when needed

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Python 3.x  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (in future projects)  

## 📌 Future Roadmap

- Regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, etc.)
- Model tuning with GridSearchCV / RandomizedSearchCV
- Neural Networks with TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Feature engineering & real-world datasets
- Deployment of ML models

📢 Feel free to follow this repository to join me on this journey!  
I will keep updating as I learn more each day.
